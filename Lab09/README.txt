I was not able to submit a .log file because for the life of me I could not get my Unit Tests to run.  
I don't even think it was a problem with my code, but my machine kept complaining about how some symbol was not found for my arm64 architecture.
But then again, I did obviously mess up somewhere, and it might still be the actual code I wrote.
Just wanted to give an explanation for why a file was missing.
