To run the project, first make sure the text file with the code words is contained within the project directory, and clone the eigen library and the google test framework from github:
  >> git clone https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen.git

Then, navigate to the directory in the command line, and create a build directory to navigate to:
  >> mkdir build
  >> cd build
Run cmake in the above directory:
  >> cmake ..
Build the project files:
  >> make
Run the project with ./run, using the name of the input file as the second argument.
For example, if the input file is named inputValues.txt and is contained in the project folder above the build directory:
  >> ./run ../inputValues.txt
And the program will decode the code words and print the corrected words, as well as if there are any errors.
