BUILD PROJECT:
1  To build the project, first make sure the input text file with the code words is contained within the project directory.
2  Clone both the eigen and google test framework libraries into the project folder:
    >> git clone https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen.git
    >> git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git 
3  Navigate to the directory in the command line, and create the build directory to navigate to:
    >> mkdir build
    >> cd build
4  Run cmake in the top level directory:
    >> cmake ..
5  Build the project files (a makefile will be generated within the build directory, hence why one is not included within this repository):
    >> make

RUN UNIT TESTS:
1  While in the build folder, run ctest:
    >> ctest
2  If detailed test results do not appear in the command line output, they are likely located at build/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log

RUN PROGRAM:
1  Run the program with ./run, using the name of the input file as the second argument.
   For example, if the input file is named inputValues.txt and is contained in the project folder above the build directory:
    >> ./run ../inputValues.txt
2  And the program will decode the code words and print the corrected words, as well as if there are any errors.
