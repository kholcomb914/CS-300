To run the project, navigate to the directory of the project in the command line, and make:
  >> make
Then, to run the program, make sure the input file with the code words is in the same directory, then enter ./main with the name of the input file in the next argument.
For example, for an input file nameed inputFile.txt, enter:
  >> ./main inputFile.txt
It will then return the decoded Hamming 7,4 words on the command line.
